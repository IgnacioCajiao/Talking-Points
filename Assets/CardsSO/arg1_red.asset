  cardDesc: "Earth's climate has changed throughout history. In the past 650,000
    years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the
    abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of
    the modern climate era\u2014and of human civilization. Most of these climate
    changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that alter the
    amount of energy our planet receives from the sun. But the warming we've seen
    over the past few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth's orbit
    and too large to be caused by solar activity.\r\n"
